# Control flow , control structures
# It is subdivided into 3 categories
# 1. Sequential control flow-> Default flow of a program , the program execution is done line by line

# number1 = int(input("Enter the first number"))
# number2 = int(input("Enter the second number"))
#
# result = number1 + number2
# print("")
# print(result)

# 2. Decisional , selection control flow -> Flow of the Program based on condition
# if, if..else, if ...elif ...else,nested if
# FlowCharts

# if statements

num = int(input("Enter the number"))

if num > 2:
    print(num)
    print("The number is greater or equal to zero")
else:
    print(num)
    print("The number is greater or equal to zero ")

    # Using the modulus operator %, test a number from a user whether its odd or even
    # number % 2 == 0 -> Even
    # Else -> Odd


num = int(input("Enter your number"))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is an odd")
